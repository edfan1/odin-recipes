    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cake is very popular in the East Coast. Natale's Bakery in New Jersey is famous for this cake. I made a small cake but this recipe can be easily doubled and baked in a 12 cup tube or Bundt pan. The powdered sugar is a must on this cake.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter-flavored vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a tube or Bundt pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat butter, cream cheese, and shortening together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat flour mixture into cream cheese mixture and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Beat in 1 egg. Add 1/2 cup sugar; mix until combined. Repeat with second egg and remaining sugar; beat in last egg. Beat in vanilla extract. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 38 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove cake from pan and cool completely. When cake is completely cool, sift powdered sugar in a thick layer over the whole cake.</li>
    </ol>
